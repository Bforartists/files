These icons are made for Blender and Bforartists. This software is under GPL V3 license.

However, the here provided icon material is not part of the source code in the first place. The icons are independently created, and just used in the software then. 
The copyright at the icons remains at the icon authors. Which gives them the right to put the icons under any license they want.

Just the material that is in the Blender or Bforartists repository falls under GPL, in conjunction with Bforartists or Blender. 

This package still contains some just slightly altered material from the Blender icon sheet. Those icons are under CC BY license by the Blender author. 
I don't claim to have any rights at those icons. I just provide them here to have a central place to maintain the icons for Bforartists.
When in doubt, open the Blender icon sheet and compare the icons with the ones in this package.

The rest of the icons, exclusively made for Bforartists, are under Public Domain license.
